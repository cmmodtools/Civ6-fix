This script will rename files as required so that Civilization VI can find them
on case-sensitive file systems.

Aspyr states:

"Civilization VI does not support hard drive volumes formatted as Mac OS Extended (CaseSensitive)".

However after this script has been run Civilization VI will work on
case-sensitive volumes. Only functionality with the Mac App Store version of
Civilization VI has been tested:
